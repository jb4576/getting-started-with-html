<h3><b>How the Web Works</b></h3>

<p>The web is a collection of computers, servers and devices that communicate using a variety of standards.  
The most common standard for web pages is the the HTML <i>(Hypertext Markup Language)</i> standard with the latest common release being HTML5.
These pages are commonly viewed on web browsers such as Internet Explorer, Firefox and Chrome.  Most web pages are delivered over TCP port 80 when performing an HTTP request.<br><br>

<h3>Elements</h3>
<p>HTML documents are made up of various HTML <i>elements</i> that have a start and an end tag with content in between.  The <i>elements</i> can work without an end tag but that <i>element</i> property will apply to all content after the start tag.
An end tag is recommended regardless if it is required.<br><br>

<h3>Attributes</h3>
<p>HTML <i>attributes</i> provide additional details in reference to HTML elements.  These <i>attributes</i> can be an element value or provide additional information.<br><br>

<h3>Block and Inline Elements</h3>
<p>HTML elements are either <i>inline</i> or <i>block</i>. Block elements form an "invisible box" and divide the documents into sections.  Inline elements only occupy the space bounded by the tages of the inline element.
